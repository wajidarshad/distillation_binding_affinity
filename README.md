# Knowledge Distillation–Based Protein–Protein Binding Affinity Prediction
(Inference-Only Usage Guide)

This repository provides an inference-only implementation of a knowledge distillation–based regression model for predicting protein–protein binding affinities from protein sequence information alone. The model has been trained using a structure-informed teacher network and a sequence-based student network, enabling the transfer of structural knowledge during training while retaining sequence-only applicability at test time.
This implementation is intended for external evaluation and practical use, consistent with the methodological standards of Bioinformatics and Briefings in Bioinformatics.
